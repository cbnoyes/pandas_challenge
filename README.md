# pandas_challenge

This challenge starts with using concepts learned through lectures such as counting, summing, and finding the averages of columns in datasets created from merging a csv, and then creating a dataframe based on that

After taking a high level snapshot, we then take a closer look using math functions with the columns and the groupby function to sort and display the data by school

From that dataframe we can look at specific aspects of each school such as size, budget, scores by grade level, and school type (district or charter). We do this through sorting, binning, groubys

Finally we use this data to analyze and make conclusions and connections about the schools and their rates of success

I received help from a BCS tutor in the School Summary section of the assignment
